# AdAwayConfig
My AdAway config that blocks almost all ads.
Just download JSON, import it on AdAway, update sources and parse them.
It has around 3mln blocked hosts and uses around 940MB of local storage.
I combine it with brave browser and PipePipe android YouTube launcher and I don't see almost any ads at all.
